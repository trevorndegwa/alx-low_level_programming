# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This project continues the journey into **pointers, arrays, and strings**, focusing on memory manipulation and multidimensional arrays.  
It introduces standard libraryâ€“like functions for memory operations, string searching, and also tasks involving matrices (like printing a chessboard and diagonal sums).

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `main.h` | Header file containing all function prototypes. |
| `_putchar.c` | Custom `_putchar` function for output. |
| `0-memset.c` | Function that fills memory with a constant byte (`_memset`). |
| `1-memcpy.c` | Function that copies memory area (`_memcpy`). |
| `2-strchr.c` | Function that locates a character in a string (`_strchr`). |
| `3-strspn.c` | Function that gets the length of a prefix substring (`_strspn`). |
| `4-strpbrk.c` | Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes (`_strpbrk`). |
| `5-strstr.c` | Function that locates a substring (`_strstr`). |
| `7-print_chessboard.c` | Function that prints the chessboard. |
| `8-print_diagsums.c` | Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix. |
| `100-set_string.c` | Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char. |
