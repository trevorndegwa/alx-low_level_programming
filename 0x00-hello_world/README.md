# C Programming - Introduction

The goal of this project is to gain a solid understanding of the basics of C.

## Requirements
- Language: C
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compiler: `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with options:
				-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files must end with a new line.
- Code must follow **Betty style**.
- No use of the `system()` function.

## Learning Objectives
- History of C and its creators (Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, Linus Torvalds).
- What happens when you compile with `gcc`.
- Understanding the entry point `main`.
- Printing text with `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Using the `sizeof` operator.
- Following official C coding style.
- How return values from `main` affect the program.
