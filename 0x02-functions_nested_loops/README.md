# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Description
This project covers **functions** and **nested loops** in C programming.  
It introduces how to structure programs into reusable blocks of code, how to use prototypes, and how to manage variable scope. The project also involves practicing with loops inside loops and building small utility functions using only `_putchar` for output.

---

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without Google:

- What nested loops are and how to use them
- What a function is and how to use functions
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What a function prototype is
- The scope of variables
- The purpose of the gcc flags:
  - `-Wall`
  - `-Werror`
  - `-Wextra`
  - `-pedantic`
  - `-std=gnu89`
- What header files are and how to use them with `#include`

---

## Requirements
- All code is written in **C** and compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
- Follow **Betty style** for code and documentation.
- No global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Not allowed to use the standard C library (`printf`, `puts`, etc. are forbidden).
- `_putchar` is allowed for output.
- Each file must end with a new line.
- All prototypes are stored in **`main.h`**.
- A `README.md` is mandatory at the root of the project.

| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | Prints the alphabet 10 times in lowercase. |
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for a lowercase character. |
| `4-isalpha.c` | Checks for an alphabetic character. |
| `5-sign.c` | Prints the sign of a number. |
| `6-abs.c` | Computes the absolute value of an integer. |
| `7-print_last_digit.c` | Prints the last digit of a number. |
| `8-24_hours.c` | Prints every minute of the day (00:00 to 23:59). |
