# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project is part of the ALX Low-Level Programming track.  
It introduces variables, conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`), and loops (`while`) in C.  
The tasks reinforce control flow, relational and logical operators, and formatted output using only `putchar` where required.  

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use arithmetic, relational, and logical operators in C
- Understand what values are considered TRUE and FALSE
- Write `if` and `if...else` statements
- Declare variables of type `int`, `char`, and `unsigned int`
- Assign values to variables
- Print variables using `printf` (where allowed) or `putchar`
- Use the `while` loop
- Work with the ASCII character set
- Understand the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

---

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All code compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- No warnings or errors during compilation
- Code must follow **Betty style**
- Only the `putchar` function is allowed for output in some tasks
- No variables of type `char` (unless explicitly allowed)
- Each file should end with a new line
